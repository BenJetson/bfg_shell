# `opt` directory

The `opt` directory contains optional scripts that customize BFG Shell.

These will likely only be useful for the author.

## Using `opt` scripts

To use an optional script on your system, you will need to invoke it from your
`local` directory.

For example, in your `$BFG_SHELL_HOME/local/config.sh`:

```sh
bfg_smart_source "opt/prompt_head_host"
```
